## Introduction
Neural isn’t just another chatbot — it’s a powerful and intuitive Discord bot powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4 model. What sets it apart is memory: Neural doesn’t just answer in the moment, it actually remembers your conversations.

- Context that Stays With You – Ask Neural to recall the conversation you had yesterday at 4pm, and it’ll pick up right where you left off. No need to repeat yourself.
- Smarter Over Time – Neural builds a personalized understanding of your server’s chats, making interactions feel natural and seamless.
- Never Forget Again – From casual banter to serious brainstorming, Neural keeps track so you can jump back into ideas without losing momentum.
- Fast, Reliable, and Intuitive – Built for speed and clarity, Neural blends into your server’s workflow instead of slowing it down.
